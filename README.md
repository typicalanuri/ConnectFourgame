# ConnectFourgame
This 2-player game mimics Connect Four. In the beginning each player is asked to choose between the character 'X' or 'O', from there each player is prompted
and asked to choose a column to place their game piece. Each round, the state of the game board is analyzed and if a winner is present (meaning that there
are four character pieces placed next to each other), the game ends and the winner is announced.
